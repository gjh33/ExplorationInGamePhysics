# Before you dive in
This topic requires some prerequisite knowledge that is outside of the scope of what I'm trying to show. For example you should be comfortable with basic linear algebra and calculus. Knowing how to do simple things like dot products, projection and other fundamental vecotor math is vital to discussion. If you find yourself not familiar with the terms presented, there are lots of great resources for linear algebra and calculus.

These algorithms are all meant to provide all information needed for a physics engine. For example, all the physics test will show you how to get a distance function, minimum translation vector, collision points, etc.
